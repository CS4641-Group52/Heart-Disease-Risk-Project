### Motivation & Background
Today, heart disease is a leading cause of death around the globe. In the United States alone, heart disease claims the life of one person every 36 seconds. Annually, it is responsible for the deaths of roughly 655,000 Americans which equates to 1 in every 4 deaths. To make matters worse, it costs our country about $219 billion per year due to healthcare service costs, medical costs, and lost productivity costs. Our group understands the impact this disease can have on so many individuals. Because of this, we decided to carry out our machine learning project on the prediction of heart disease.
